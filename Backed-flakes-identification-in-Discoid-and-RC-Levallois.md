## Abstract

Backed flakes (core edge flakes and pseudo-Levallois points) represent a
special product of Middle Paleolithic flaking strategies. This especial
character results from their role as a technological objective and as
the management of core convexity aiming to retain the geometric
properties of the core in a knapping strategy. On Middle Paleolithic
contexts these backed implements are commonly the result of Levallois
and Discoid knapping strategies. Both backed implements are common to
both knapping methods and in many occasions they share common geometric
and morphological features which hinders their adscription to one of the
methods. This study examines the identification of two knapping
strategies (Discoid and Levallois recurrent centripetal) on an
experimental assemblage of backed products (including all stages of
reduction) based on their morphological features. 3D Geometric
Morphometrics are employed to quantify morphological variability among
the experimental sample. Dimensionality reduction though Principal
Component Analysis is combined with eleven Machine Learning models for
the identification of knapping methods. The best model (SVM with
polynomial kernel) presented a general accuracy of 0.76 and an Area
Under the Curve of 0.8. This indicates that Geometric Morphometrics,
Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning models succeed in
capturing the morphological differences of backed products according to
the knapping method.

## Introduction

The Middle Paleolithic in Western Europe is characterized by the
diversification and increase of knapping methods resulting in
flake-dominated assemblages (Kuhn [2013](#ref-%5B@kuhn_roots_2013%5D))
