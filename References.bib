	abstract = {The importance of the transport of stone artefacts in structuring Neandertal lithic assemblages has often been addressed, but the degree to which this led to fragmentation of lithic reduction over Middle Palaeolithic landscapes has not been explicitly studied thus far. Large-scale excavations of Middle Palaeolithic open-air sites and refitting studies of the retrieved assemblages have yielded new, highresolution data on the mobile aspects of Neandertal stone tool technology. In this paper, we integrate lithic technology and raw material data from recent studies of Middle Palaeolithic open-air and rock shelter sites {inWestern} Europe.We demonstrate that the results of a variety of typological, technological (especially refitting), and lithological studies have important consequences for our knowledge of the acquisition of raw materials and subsequent production, usage and discard of stone artefacts in the Middle Palaeolithic. Neandertal production and use of stone tools was fragmented in three domains: the spatial, the temporal and the social domain. We show that this versatile segmentation of stone artefact handling strategies is a main determinant of the character of the Neandertal archaeological record. Our data testify to ubiquitous and continuous transport of stone artefacts of a wide variety of forms, picked by Neandertals using selection criteria that were sometimes far removed from what archaeologists have traditionally considered, and to some degree still consider, to be desired end products of knapping activities. The data presented here testify to the variability and versatility of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool technology, whose fragmented character created very heterogeneous archaeological assemblages, usually the product of a wide variety of independent import, use, discard and/or subsequent transport events.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, many scholars have progressively produced new data concerning the various methods employed in production of lithic implements. The corpus has allowed to detail the different flaking concepts and at same time to describe their specific singularities as well as their variability. In most of the studies focused on lithic technology, variability of methods implicit in the discoid concept has been storically negletted. Very frequently, an attribution to this flaking method has been produced in accordance to its classical meaning, in denying its diversity and impoverishing its interpretation. With the aim to disentangle this situation, we have tried to consider over many Middle Palaeolihic cases in Western Europe where discoid technology has been documented, by taking into account data in literature as well as new results provided from the study of archaeological sites in North-Eastern Iberian Peninsule (Cave 120, Roca dels Bous rockshelter, open-air site of Mediona I). We have tried to integrate information of this lithic assemblages within a unique flaking concept, seeking its identification features and precising its idiosyncrasy. This concept is materialized by a unique structure with a strong stability in its volumetric conception, nothwistanding a certain flexibility of its rules, that allow to develop different modalities of core management, always oriented towards the same technological conception. The preference of one method rather than others maybe explained in quantitative terms (production intensification) and by reference to the constrictive circumstances due to the original core shape. In spite of this diversity of applicable methods, a great uniformity exists in the predetermination criteria that manage the technical aims to be satisfied. These criteria are very homogeneous, at least by comparison with the criteria developed for other flaking methods.},

Among these, we include the strategies of resource exploitation and territorial mobility, and the productivity and eﬀectiveness rates between the two methods. Though both highlighting diﬀerences, these cannot justify a sharp change in production strategies. Looking speciﬁcally at the technological objectives, we compared a category of common products: the backed artefacts. This category includes similar tools, but morphofunctional diﬀerences suggest diﬀerent degrees of eﬃciency. The comparison helped to better deﬁne the Discoid and Levallois technologies in their functional and potential objectives, whose variations may have inﬂuenced the alternating pattern in the technological choices here recorded.},

The new approach enabled differentiating the blanks created by both knapping methods with an accuracy {\textgreater}80\% using only ten typometric variables. The most relevant variables were maximum length, width to the 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of the flake length, external and internal platform angles, maximum width and number of dorsal scars.

	abstract = {Genetic and climate-driven estimates of past population dynamics are increasingly inﬂuential in broader models of hominin migration and adaptation, yet the contribution of stone artifact variability remains more contentious. Scientists are increasingly recognizing the potential of unretouched stone ﬂakes (‘ﬂakes’) in exploring existing models of hominin behavioral evolution. This is because ﬂakes (1) were produced by all stone tool manufacturing groups in the past, (2) are abundant from the inception of the archaeological record up into the ethnographic present, and (3) preserve under most conditions. The statistical tools of 3D geometric morphometrics capture detailed approximations of ﬂake form that are challenging to document with conventional artifact analyses. We analyze a collection of 717 3D scans of experimentally produced ﬂakes from 5 production strategies that were practiced by hominins through large parts of the Pleistocene and that scientists have drawn on also to make demographic arguments about past human behavior (n ¼ 45 reduction sequences, n ¼ 3 knappers naive toward the study objectives). First, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we can estimate the strategies used to produce these ﬂakes at a high success rate even when ﬂakes from early stages of core reduction are included. We frame the signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding against archaeological classiﬁcations from several key Middle Paleolithic assemblages in France (n ¼ 4 sites, n ¼ 28 layers, n ¼ 16,467 ﬂakes). Second, we show that 3D geometric morphometrics captures subtle differences in these strategies that inﬂuence ﬂake formation on a ﬂake-by-ﬂake basis and that reﬂect decisions made by knappers about platform selection, preparation, and core-surface management. We explore the broader potential of our model with a crossvalidation approach, and we describe a means of assessing ﬂake form on a continuum wherein variability among assemblages separated by large expanses of space and time can be meaningfully explored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Speciÿcally, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to ÿt the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Morphometrics, a new branch of statistics, combines tools from geometry, computer graphics and biometrics in techniques for the multivariate analysis of biological shape variation. Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of conﬁgurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign pointto-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary ﬁlters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of {MRI} of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {The research during the construction of the M-50 highway has allowed the study of the silica levels that constitute the most important Neolithic flint mine in the Iberian Peninsula. A group of more than 3.800 extraction pits were realized to obtain cherts and opals that appear among Mg smectites beds (Aragonian deposits). The description of the nodular and stratiform silica levels and the study of their types and distribution have been done at geological sections obtained during the archaeological excavations. Three petrological types of siliceous rocks (chert, opal and opaline chert) are established and defined according to their mineralogy and microfacies. Cherts are constituted only by quartz and locally minor amounts of moganite. Opals contain opal {CT}, Mg smectites and minor quartz. Opaline chert is defined when the proportion of quartz is higher than 50\%. All the types of siliceous rocks reproduce bioturbation structures as well as other structures found in the host rocks (grains, intraclasts, brecciation). The silica levels at the base of the columns are constituted only by chert and were formed by the silicification of nodular and lenticular dolomite levels included in the Mg-smectites beds. The rest of the siliceous levels are composed of opals and opaline cherts and were formed by silicification of Mg-smectites. The outer part of the opaline chert has a higher content in opal and clay relicts whereas the inner part is mainly microcrystalline quartz. This change is consequence of the recrystallization of the opal (aging) producing a more compact silica rock. The main silicification occurred under the groundwater table because the structure of the host rocks is conserved in the silica rocks. A general question is whether the silica that precipites is introduced by groundwater or it is released from the dissolution of clays during their replacement.},

	abstract = {The Miocene of the Madrid basin includes relatively abundant silica rocks (cherts, opals and opaline cherts), which were used during the Palaeolithic and Neolithic to make lithic tools. This work establishes the chemical characteristics that can be used to classify those silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location, explaining at the same time their mineralogical, petrological and geochemical features. The geographical classification of silica rocks is very useful to define the source areas of lithic tools made during the Prehistory. The mineralogical and petrological classification was made using transmitted light optical microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectrometry. Chemical analyses of major, minor and rare elements were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma ({ICP}) mass and emission spectrometry. Most of the silica rocks from the Miocene of the Madrid basin were formed by the replacement of sedimentary rocks that constitute the infill of the basin. This process implies the dissolution of the host rock (limestone, dolostone, gypsum, clays, etc.) and the precipitation of silica minerals (quartz, opaline phases and moganite). Both, the chemical composition of the host rock relicts and the elements incorporated by the opaline phases, constitutes a characteristic geochemical signature from each sampled zone (sample group). Therefore, this signature can be used to define and characterize silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location. The study of the data was carried out using bivariate analysis (i.e. correlation coefficients) and multivariate analysis (i.e. main components and the discriminant function). All the chemical elements analyzed are important in the discriminant analysis, because when fewer elements are taken into account (even when only those elements with a lower weight in the discriminant function are removed), the number of samples that can be included in the groups decreases importantly.},

Their geographical and chronological distributions show some general trends: a greater diversity of the production systems coexisting within the same region (especially in Southwestern France) at the end of the Middle Paleolithic; an increased use of the systems characterized by a low degree of blank predetermination (Quina and discoidal systems, Levallois recurrent centripetal method), and the emergence of a flexible, multifunctional toolkit with a high curation potential. These changes can be attributed to groups with different technical traditions who kept their own fundamental technical identity but who also adopted similar mobility patterns during the unstable climatic period at the end of the Middle Paleolithic, resulting in shared forms of socioeconomic behavior (frequent population moves and increased residential mobility).},

	abstract = {L’Arbreda, secteur alpha, fouillé en 1972 par J.M. Corominas, présente une stratigraphie moustérienne de plus de 3 mètres (couches 30 à 44), comprise entre le début du stade isotopique 5 et le stade 3. Les sept ensembles stratigraphiques moustériens (G à A) se sont déposés durant des phases fortement humides et humides/fraîches (G à F), froides à extrêmement froides (E à C), puis plus tempéreés-fraîches (B à A). Les différents ensembles industriels de l’Arbreda peuvent être rattachés typologiquement au grand complexe du Moustérien typique méditerranéen de la frange orientale des Pyrénées, bien que fortement marqués par des influences charentiennes. L’abondance des collections (près de 14 000 pièces) et la variabilité des types de matières premières (porphyres, cornéennes, grès, calcaires, lydiennes et plusieurs types de quartz, quartzites et silex), toutes en quantités importantes, permettent différentes approches technologiques. Les patrimoines techniques hérités, les capacités d’adaptabilité et de compréhension des roches ainsi que leur mise en oeuvre, sont recherchés par la variabilité des méthodes et des techniques de production pour chaque type de roche à partir d’une approche diachronique. Selon une approche chronologique et toutes matières premières confondues sont décelées les évolutions générales des techniques et des modalités de production ainsi que leurs différentes associations intégrées par ces groupes moustériens sur une période de 80 000 ans. D’autant plus qu’une assez forte cohésion typologique se dessine tout au long de la stratigraphie. Cette continuité peut laisser entrevoir une certaine stabilité des groupes moustériens dans le sens de l’héritage et du patrimoine culturels. Ces études sont favorisées aussi par la continuité des grandes lignes technologiques de débitage qui s’articulent autour des méthodes discoïdes et Levallois. De ce fait, il est possible d’appréhender les évolutions et les associations technologiques importantes au travers de leurs différentes modalités.},

Its adoption in an altogether diﬀerent role in bio-assay has been determined decisively by the individual actions and personal histories of a few scholars: the widespread acceptance of the growth function is due to Pearl and Reed, the general recognition of Verhulst’s primacy to Yule, and the introduction of the function in bio-assay to Berkson.},

Nowhere has this topic provoked more interest and debate than in the Middle Palaeolithic of southwestern France. The region's rich archaeological record has produced numerous sites, many of which have been recently excavated and thus provide a reliable dataset for better structuring Mousterian lithic variability. Researchers working with these types of datasets frequently employ the chaîne op eratoire concept to approach lithic assemblage variability; however, the validity of such analyses has recently been questioned. Here we present results of a combined quantitative and qualitative technological analysis of a large sample of assemblages from numerous well-contextualised sites in the northeastern Aquitaine Basin. We selected clearly identiﬁable diagnostic elements typical of different ﬂake production systems that can be quantiﬁed by different analysts in a replicable fashion. Our results show strong differences in assemblage composition in terms of dominant production systems as well as a smaller number of mixed assemblages that combine two or more ﬂake production methods. When considered together, these results provide not only a means for deﬁning lithic technocomplexes and subsequently comparing assemblages but also for investigating elements of Neanderthal material culture variability.},

The sequence at Axlor exemplifies this variability revealing important changes in technology from ca. 55e45 ka {BP}. A major shift from stable occupations with a Levallois-based technology to shorter occupations with a Quina-based technology is observed. The critical analysis of the available information for the Middle Paleolithic assemblages in the region reveals six major phases: an Early Middle Paleolithic (170e100 ka {BP}), an undefined Middle Paleolithic (90e60 ka {BP}), a Vasconian (Discoid technology with cleavers e 60e50 ka {BP}), a Levallois Mousterian (55e50 ka {BP}), a Quina Mousterian (50e45 ka {BP}) and a Late Mousterian (45e40 ka {BP}). Although the Levallois and Quina Mousterian phases seem to be adaptations to the rapid environmental changes happening during the first phases of {MIS}3 (between {DO}16e17 and {DO}12), there are other factors that also influenced the configuration of these different technological systems, such as the modification of settlement systems or changes in Neanderthal group organization, and the resulting transformation of social needs.},

	abstract = {Technological changes have been identified in several European Middle Palaeolithic sites. Specifically, the turnover in discoid and Levallois knapping methods has traditionally been explained by raw material constraints that are usually related to foraging areas and mobility strategies of Neanderthal groups. While Levallois production requires high homogeneous blocks, predominant discoid techno-complexes have generally been interpreted as better adapted to the scarcity of high quality raw material, not only for the lowest degree of control in products morphology, but also for their multitask characteristics. Nevertheless, the impact of the quality of raw material has never been systematically studied. Furthermore, technological analyses usually consider the lithic assemblage as a whole and do not dissect assemblages to identify single events, which are units that are needed to interpret relationships between technological organisation, human mobility, economic strategies, and settlement patterns. Here, we present an application of technological analysis with a high-resolution approach to investigate, in detail, how raw material quality affected production and how Neanderthals managed the low quality of Sant Martí de Tous chert within Levallois and discoid concepts. We used Raw Material Units and refits as units of analysis with a diacritical approach. The results suggested that the Levallois organisation of the reduction sequence in layer O included a phase of selection of the block and its systematic cutting-down, as well as quite standardised productive procedures and a high fragmentation of the productive sequence within the landscape. In layer M discoid sequences showed a high internal variability as a response to raw material constraints, and most of the production was usually manufactured at the site. Data implied that factors others than the quality of raw material determined the technological turnover at Abric Romaní, suggesting that social organisation and settlement patterns have most probably played a more significant role than foraging area.},

	abstract = {A use-wear analysis was carried out on a specific mobile toolkit belonging to level M of the Middle Paleolithic site of Abric Romaní (Barcelona, Spain), which is dated to {MIS} 3, between 51 and 55 Ka {BP}. In an environment rich in local and regional chert sources and in a technological context marked by expedient behavior, a set of flakes, which also included debordant elements with asymmetric transversal sections, were introduced into the site having already been knapped. A combination of technological, refitting, and raw material unit analyses ({RMU}) have distinguished them from the rest of the chert artifacts knapped in situ. Given that the aim of the reduction sequences in level M, as in most of the stratigraphic sequence, is the production of small flakes of poor quality chert, the introduction of these finished tools indicates the existence of planned behavior in relation to raw material constraints and, to a major extent, with specific needs. The question is whether there is any functional difference between these flakes knapped outside and those produced on-site. A first step to solving this issue is the evaluation of the potential of these tools for use-wear analysis. Thirty-seven flakes were selected for this study prioritizing the state of surface preservation. To provide reliable data with which to compare the archeological traces, we have performed a specific experimental program using the main chert varieties identified in the archeological sample. Digital 3D, optical, and scanning electron microscopies were combined to characterize wear patterns in a mobile toolkit. Our preliminary results show that, despite the significant patination on some of the pieces, a limited array of tools have a good state of surface preservation and show use-wear evidence related to a variety of butchery activities.},

Three knapping concentrations in the southwest sector of the site produced two-thirds of the overall lithic assemblage, the remaining pieces were found scattered across the excavated area.

Reﬁtted reduction sequences and our spatial analysis conﬁrm the three lithic concentrations to be contemporaneous and, by extension, to form part of a single Mousterian occupation with multiple technological components.
