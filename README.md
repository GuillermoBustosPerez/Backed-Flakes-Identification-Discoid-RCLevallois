## Abstract

Backed flakes (core edge flakes and pseudo-Levallois points) represent
special products of Middle Paleolithic centripetal flaking strategies.
Their peculiarities are due to their roles as both a technological
objective and in the management of core convexities to retain its
geometric properties during reduction. In Middle Paleolithic contexts,
these backed implements are commonly produced during Levallois and
discoidal reduction sequences. Backed products from Levallois and
discoidal reduction sequences often show common geometric and
morphological features that complicate their attribution to one of these
methods. This study examines the identification of experimentally
produced discoidal and recurrent centripetal Levallois backed products
(including all stages of reduction) based on their morphological
features. 3D geometric morphometrics are employed to quantify
morphological variability among the experimental sample. Dimensionality
reduction though principal component analysis is combined with 11
machine learning models for the identification of knapping methods. A
supported vector machine with polynomial kernel has been identified as
the best model (with a general accuracy of 0.76 and an area under the
curve \[AUC\] of 0.8). This indicates that combining geometric
morphometrics, principal component analysis, and machine learning models
succeeds in capturing the morphological differences of backed products
according to the knapping method.
